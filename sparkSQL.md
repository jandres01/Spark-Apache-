4. 

a. 6.922916666666667 average of the months for NM
b. 7.001939655172413 is simple average unemployment rate for NM in 2017

#### Out of Class Problems
1.
c.6.495316715138995 weighted average for all counties for NM in 2017

d. I find the simple average a lazy average of the data. I also think the average of the months is not most accurate because we do not have data for all the months in 2017. I would choose the weighted average value because having weights for each values importance gives a much more precise result in my opinion. 

2. Highest unemployment rate is 54.1 in year 1990 period M02 in Rio Grande, TX
